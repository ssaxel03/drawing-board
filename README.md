# Drawing Board

## Summary
The Drawing Board is a Java-based tool for creating grid-based artwork. Users can interact with a grid where each cell represents a "pixel," allowing for intuitive painting and erasing. This makes it an ideal platform for designing pixel-style art or simple patterns. Its straightforward interface ensures that users of all skill levels can easily engage with the application.

One of its key features is the ability to save and load canvases. Users can save their creations to a file and reload them later, making it convenient to resume projects or refine previous designs. Lightweight yet versatile, the Drawing Board combines simplicity with practical functionality, offering an enjoyable experience for digital art creation.
